NOTES:
Please do not push to master, create a branch and push to your branch.
When you believe your branch is ready to be merged into master, 
create a pull request with your changes and type @CharlieMartell
then comment about your changes.

To create a new branch (before changes):

Get latest code:
git checkout master && git pull

Open new branch:
git checkout -b "*username*/my-branch-name"

When you have made some changes and wish to save progress:
git add *files you want to add*
git commit -m "meaningful message about changes"
git push origin "*username*/my-branch-name"

When you are sure your code is ready to be merged:
Go to github.com/Tribe-Development and you will see your branch
Click Create and pull request and leave a message about your changes
and make sure to type @charliemartell

I will review your changes and ensure they are good to be merged with master.
